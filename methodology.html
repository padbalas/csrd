      <h1>Methodology & Disclosures</h1>
      <p class="muted">How CarbonWise calculates Scope 2 electricity emissions (tCO₂e), Scope 1 stationary combustion estimates, and Scope 3 screening-level spend-based estimates.</p>
    </header>

    <!-- Scope coverage clarity -->
    <section>
      <h2>Scope Covered</h2>
      <p>CarbonWise supports Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity, Scope 1 emissions from stationary natural gas combustion, and Scope 3 screening-level estimates using spend-based EIO models. Each scope has its own inputs, factors, and disclosures.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-2">
      <h2>Scope 2 Methodology (Electricity)</h2>
      <p><strong>Inputs</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Monthly electricity usage (kWh), billing month/year, and country/region.</p>
      <p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Location-based Scope 2 emissions are calculated by multiplying kWh by the grid emission factor for the selected location.</p>
      <p><strong>Emission factors</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Factors represent average grid emissions intensity by country/region. They are sourced from public, government-issued datasets and are year-stamped.</p>
      <p><strong>Factor year alignment</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Grid factors are published after the year they describe. CarbonWise may use the most recent final factor if an exact year match is unavailable.</p>
      <p><strong>Location-based vs market-based</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Location-based is the default. Market-based adjustments are optional and user-declared (RECs/PPAs). Uncovered electricity remains location-based.</p>
      <p class="muted">CarbonWise does not verify certificates, contracts, or registry claims. Market-based results are estimates intended for internal reporting.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-1">
      <h2>Scope 1 Methodology (Stationary combustion — Natural gas)</h2>
      <p><strong>What is included</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Stationary combustion only, natural gas, owned/controlled facilities, and heating/boilers/furnaces/generators with regular metered usage.</p>
      <p><strong>What is excluded</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Mobile combustion, fugitive emissions, process emissions, backup generators with irregular usage (unless metered), personal fuel use, and shared buildings without clear allocation.</p>
      <p><strong>Inputs</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Monthly fuel quantity, unit, billing month/year, and facility location.</p>
      <p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Scope 1 emissions are calculated by multiplying the reported fuel quantity by the applicable stationary combustion factor for the location and unit.</p>
      <p><strong>Emission factors</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Factors are sourced from public, government-issued datasets and are year-stamped.</p>
      <p><strong>Estimation limitations</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Results are partial and may omit other Scope 1 sources. Factors are simplified and are not a full inventory or verification.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-3">
      <h2>Scope 3 Methodology (EIO-Only)</h2>
      <p><strong>What spend-based EIO modeling is</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Scope 3 v1 uses environmentally extended input-output (EIO) models to estimate emissions from spend. Spend in each category is multiplied by a national-average EIO factor expressed as tCO₂e per currency unit.</p>
      <p><strong>Supported categories (v1)</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Purchased Goods & Services (General), Professional Services, Software & Cloud Services, Marketing & Advertising Services, and Logistics & Shipping (Upstream, spend-based only).</p>
      <p class="muted">CarbonWise intentionally limits Scope 3 v1 to a small set of high-confidence categories to prioritize clarity and defensibility over broad but uncertain coverage.</p>
      <p><strong>Limitations and uncertainty</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">These results are screening-level only, based on average sector data. They do not use supplier-specific data, activity quantities, or process-based LCA. Uncertainty is high and results should not be treated as audit-grade.</p>
      <p><strong>Appropriate use cases</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Early screening, directional insights, and prioritization for deeper analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Inappropriate use cases</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Audits, supplier claims, product-level LCAs, or public-facing assertions of supplier performance.</p>
      <p class="muted">Scope 3 emissions shown here are screening-level estimates calculated using spend-based environmentally extended input-output (EIO) models. Results are indicative only and subject to high uncertainty.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Precision, Rounding, and Comparability</h2>
      <p>Calculations retain reasonable numeric precision. Results may differ from other tools because of emission factor selection, year alignment, or rounding conventions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Intended Use & Limitations</h2>
      <p>CarbonWise supports internal reporting, planning, and disclosure preparation. It does not replace third-party verification or formal assurance, and users remain responsible for final reporting decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Updates & Changes</h2>
      <p>Emission factors and methodology may be updated as new data becomes available. Significant changes will be documented so you can understand what changed and why.</p>
