      <h1>Methodology & Disclosures</h1>
      <p class="muted">How CarbonWise calculates Scope 2 electricity emissions (tCO₂e), including optional user-declared market-based adjustments and Scope 1 estimates.</p>
    </header>

    <!-- Scope coverage clarity -->
    <section>
      <h2>Scope Covered</h2>
      <p>CarbonWise supports Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity and Scope 1 emissions from stationary natural gas combustion. Each scope has its own inputs, factors, and disclosures.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-2">
      <h2>Scope 2 Methodology (Electricity)</h2>
      <p><strong>Inputs</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Monthly electricity usage (kWh), billing month/year, and country/region.</p>
      <p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Location-based Scope 2 emissions are calculated by multiplying kWh by the grid emission factor for the selected location.</p>
      <p><strong>Emission factors</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Factors represent average grid emissions intensity by country/region. They are sourced from public, government-issued datasets and are year-stamped.</p>
      <p><strong>Factor year alignment</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Grid factors are published after the year they describe. CarbonWise may use the most recent final factor if an exact year match is unavailable.</p>
      <p><strong>Location-based vs market-based</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Location-based is the default. Market-based adjustments are optional and user-declared (RECs/PPAs). Uncovered electricity remains location-based.</p>
      <p class="muted">CarbonWise does not verify certificates, contracts, or registry claims. Market-based results are estimates intended for internal reporting.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-1">
      <h2>Scope 1 Methodology (Stationary combustion — Natural gas)</h2>
      <p><strong>What is included</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Stationary combustion only, natural gas, owned/controlled facilities, and heating/boilers/furnaces/generators with regular metered usage.</p>
      <p><strong>What is excluded</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Mobile combustion, fugitive emissions, process emissions, backup generators with irregular usage (unless metered), personal fuel use, and shared buildings without clear allocation.</p>
      <p><strong>Inputs</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Monthly fuel quantity, unit, billing month/year, and facility location.</p>
      <p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Scope 1 emissions are calculated by multiplying the reported fuel quantity by the applicable stationary combustion factor for the location and unit.</p>
      <p><strong>Emission factors</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Factors are sourced from public, government-issued datasets and are year-stamped.</p>
      <p><strong>Estimation limitations</strong></p>
      <p class="muted">Results are partial and may omit other Scope 1 sources. Factors are simplified and are not a full inventory or verification.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Precision, Rounding, and Comparability</h2>
      <p>Calculations retain reasonable numeric precision. Results may differ from other tools because of emission factor selection, year alignment, or rounding conventions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Intended Use & Limitations</h2>
      <p>CarbonWise supports internal reporting, planning, and disclosure preparation. It does not replace third-party verification or formal assurance, and users remain responsible for final reporting decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Updates & Changes</h2>
      <p>Emission factors and methodology may be updated as new data becomes available. Significant changes will be documented so you can understand what changed and why.</p>
